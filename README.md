# Machine Learning and Statistics - Assesment
This repository contains my solution for the assessment of Machine Learning and Statistics in GMIT

## Instructions
This assessment concerns the well-known Boston House Prices dataset and the Python packages scipy, keras, and jupyter. It is broken into three parts, as follows.
1. (20%) Describe: Create a git repository and make it available online for the lecturer to clone. The repository should contain all your work for this assessment. Within the repository, create a jupyter notebook that uses descriptive statistics and plots to describe the Boston House Prices dataset.
2. (20%) Infer: To the above jupyter notebook, add a section where you use inferential statistics to analyse whether there is a significant difference in median house prices between houses that are along the Charles river and those that aren’t. You should explain and discuss your findings within the notebook.
3. (60%) Predict: Again using the same notebook, use keras [7] to create a neural network that can predict the median house price based on the other variables in the dataset. You are free to interpret this as you wish — for example, you may use all the other variables, or select a subset.

## How to Download the Repository
1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under the repository name, click Clone or download.
3. In the Clone with HTTPs section, click to copy the clone URL for the repository.
4. Open Git Bash.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2. 7/ Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

## Libraries Used 
1. [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/) - NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things; a powerful N-dimensional array object, sophisticated (broadcasting) functions, tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code, useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.
2. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) -  an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.
3. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.
4. [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) - is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
5. [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) - is a software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.
6. [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) - is open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. This project specifically uses the scipy.stats module which contains a large number of probability distributions as well as a growing library of statistical functions.
7. [StatsModels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) - is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration.
8. [Keras](https://keras.io/) - Keras is an open-source neural-network library written in Python. It’s used for building deep learning models.
